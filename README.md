# Hypothesis-rs

My research project of porting [Hypothesis](https://github.com/HypothesisWorks/hypothesis) to Rust. The main goal is
to deepen my understanding of how Hypothesis works and improve my Rust skills.

This project doesn't aim to be a complete port - it is more about having fun.

In `crates` you may find Rust implementation of various Hypothesis's components. The `bindings` directory contains Python
bindings to them.
